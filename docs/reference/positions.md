# Normative Positions

Normative frames are a specific type of object, representing Hohfeld’s framework of normative concepts[^1] which includes 8 notions, distributed on 2 squares, concerning respectively deontic (or duty-related) and potestative (or power-related) directives.

Similarly to [eFLINT](https://gitlab.com/eflint), these concepts corresponds in DCPL to object-types with certain fixed parameters (frames, or stereotypical knowledge constructs).
Their instantiation, as that of any other object, can be conditioned by transformational or reactive [rules](rules.md).

## Power Frames

Powers specify an `action` and an optional `consequence` for that action, along with an optional `holder` of the power (i.e. the class of [agents](objects-and-events.md#agents) that may perform the `action`). A power frame can be of any of the following classes: `power`, `liability`, `disability`, and `immunity`; it has the following properties:

| property      | type                                                 | default     | description                                                |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `holder`      | [`agent`](../reference/objects-and-events.md#agents) | `*`         | the agent that detains the power                           |
| `action`      | [`event`](../reference/objects-and-events.md#events) | `undefined` | the action that the holder has power to perform            |
| `consequence` | [`directive`](../reference/objects-and-events.md)    | `undefined` | a directive that is triggered when the action is performed |

!!! example

    Agents that are `student` or `staff` can `#register` as `member` of the library by using their `id_card` (example of act creating a new [descriptor](objects-and-events.md#descriptors) qualification).

        power {
            holder: student | staff
            action: #register { instrument: holder.id_card }
            consequence: holder becomes member
        }

## Deontic Frames

A deontic frame is an object which can be of any of the following classes: `duty`, `prohibition`,`liberty`,`claim`,`protection`, `no_claim`; it has the following properties:

| property       | type                                                          | default     | description                                                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `holder`       | [`agent`](../reference/objects-and-events.md#agents)          | `*`         | the agent to which the duty applies                              |
| `counterparty` | [`agent`](../reference/objects-and-events.md#agents)          | `*`         | the agent which is interested in the fulfillment of the duty     |
| `action`       | [`event`](../reference/objects-and-events.md#events)          | `undefined` | the action to perform in order to fulfill the duty               |
| `violation`    | [`external_expression`](../reference/external-expressions.md) | `undefined` | an expression to evaluate to determine when the duty is violated |
| `termination`  | [`external_expression`](../reference/external-expressions.md) | `undefined` | an expression to evaluate when the duty should terminate         |

All objects are here referred through [descriptors](../reference/objects-and-events.md#descriptors), which can be complete or partial. The referring mechanism is similar to Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) in the sense that the refinement may reduce the number of objects to which the policy applies.

!!! example

    By borrowing, the borrower can be requested in any moment to return the item. The borrower has the duty to return the item within the given date. If the borrower does not return the item, they may be fined (example of composite object, with power, duty and violation constructs).

        duty {
            holder: borrower
            counterparty: lender
            action: #return { item: book }
            violation: now() > timeout
        }
